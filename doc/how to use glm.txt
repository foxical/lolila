1. First, download OpenGL Mathematics library here
https://github.com/g-truc/glm

2. Second, extract and copy folder "../glm/glm" to your project location at "../app/src/main/cpp"

3. Third, on CMakeList.txt, add the following:

# Import the CMakeLists.txt for the glm library
add_subdirectory(glm) # if your CMakeLists is at '../cpp'
# add_subdirectory(src/main/cpp/glm) # if your CMakeLists is at '../app'

# add lib dependencies
target_link_libraries(
# Specifies the target library.
native-lib
# Links the target library to the log library included in the NDK.
GLESv2
glm)

4. Fourth, on 'build.gradle' (module app), make sure you have right path to your CMakeList

 externalNativeBuild {
        cmake {
            path "src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt"
        }
 }
